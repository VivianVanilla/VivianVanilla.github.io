    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h2>  Canny (1st Level)</h2>
    Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Turn it into an expertise.
<h2>Grudge </h2>
    At 2nd level, your deep-seated hatred sharpens your precision and lethality with ranged weapons. Choose one of the following categories to channel your grudge:
    Marking your target
    After hitting an enemy with a ranged weapon, you may concentrate on that target for up to 1 minute. While concentrating, your attacks against the chosen target gain the benefits of your grudge  including the turn you mark it.
    You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    Grudge Categories
<h3> General Grudge </h3>
    You despise a broad category of foes. Select a type of enemy (e.g., Marines, Pirates, or a specific race). While concentrating on an enemy of this type, your first attack on each turn deals an additional +1 damage. 1d4 at 6th level and to 1d6 at 14th level.
<h3>  Focused Grudge </h3>
    Your enity is directed toward a particular group or faction. Select a specific group (e.g., a pirate crew, a military squad, or a guild). While concentrating on a member of this group, your first attack on each turn deals an additional 1d6. 1d8 at 6th level and to 1d10 at 14th level.
<h3>  Personal Grudge </h3>
    You harbor an intense hatred for one individual. While concentrating on this target, your first attack on each turn deals an additional 1d10 + 1 damage. 1d12 + 1 at 6th level and to 2d6 + 1 at 14th level.
    
<h3>  Changing Your Grudge </h3>
    Once you choose a grudge, it becomes your focus. However, as you grow stronger, your priorities and enemies may change. At 6th level, and again at 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level, you may replace your current grudge with a new one, reflecting your evolving hatred.
<h2> Roving (5th Level) </h2>
    Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
<h2>  Marksman Aim </h2>
    6th Level Feature
    Your precision with ranged weapons improves dramatically. Once per turn, if you roll a 1 on a ranged weapon attack roll or damage die, you can reroll it and must use the new result.
<h2> Land's Stride </h2>
    Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
<h2> Hide in Plain Sight</h2>
    Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
    Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
<h2>  Expanded Hatred </h2>
    12th Level Feature
    Your animosity broadens, enabling you to focus on additional targets. Choose one additional grudge category: General, Focused, or Personal. You gain the benefits of this new category alongside your existing grudges.
    You can switch grudges for this additional category following the same rules as changing your original grudge.
<h2> Vanish </h2>
    Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
<h2> Foe Slayer </h2>
    At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
