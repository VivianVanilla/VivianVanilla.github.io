    <h2> Action Surge</h2>
        Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.
        Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
    <h2>  Second Wind</h2>
        You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
        Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
    <h2>  Extra Attack </h2>
        Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
        Gain another at 15th.
    <h2>  Indomitable </h2> 
        Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
        You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
    <h2> Even Further Beyond </h2>
        At 19th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increase by 4, no matter your race.
